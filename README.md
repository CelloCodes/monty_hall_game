# Monty Hall Paradox Minigame

Welcome to the Monty Hall Paradox Minigame! This web application simulates the famous probability puzzle known as the Monty Hall problem. The game is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Next.js.

## üïπÔ∏è About the Game

The Monty Hall problem is a brain teaser, in the form of a probability puzzle, loosely based on the American television game show "Let's Make a Deal" and named after its original host, Monty Hall. It is also famous in Brazil through it's satire adaptation know as Porta dos Desesperados that was played with children on a TV show, where one of the doors had a prize but the others had monsters or animals to scare the children.

### How to Play

A regular instance of the problem revolves around 3 doors, of which one contain a prize, but the number of doors in the game can be increased up to 16 for demonstration purposes.

1. **Choose a Door**: There are three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The player chooses one of the doors.
2. **Host Reveals a Door**: After the player chooses a door, the host, who knows what's behind each door, opens one of the doors. 
3. **Decide to Switch or Stay**: The player is given a choice to stick with the original door or switch to the remaining unopened door.
4. **Win or Lose**: The door choosen by the player is opened to reveal whether they have won the game or not.

The game demonstrates that switching doors gives you a higher probability of winning the car. More on that topic can be seen in the wiki page of the [Monty Hall Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem).
